# mcmc_samplers
A collection of implementations of various Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers

Currently, the only sampler implemented in this package is the base Metropolis-Hastings sampler. For an example of how to run it, see runMetropolis.py.

The sampler.py file contains a parent Sampler class with the basic details of how the samplers are implemented, and metropolisHastings.py contains the implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. This repo will be peridocially updated to contain more samplers.
